### Phase 1: Search Quality

**Goal**: Users get meaningfully ranked search results where frequently-accessed and pinned memories surface reliably, and the reranker fills the empty 0.30 weight slot in the scoring formula
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: SRCH-01, SRCH-02, SRCH-03, SRCH-04, SRCH-05, SRCH-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Search results are visibly reranked -- querying the same term returns different ordering than before, with more contextually relevant results at the top
2. User can pin a memory from the UI, and that memory consistently appears in relevant searches regardless of age
3. Viewing a search result multiple times causes it to rank higher in future searches for similar queries
4. Reranking completes within 3 seconds for a typical search (no perceptible freeze)
   **Plans**: 2 plans

## v4.0 Fix Search Once and For All (Phases 35-38)

**Milestone Goal:** Validate the entire pipeline end-to-end -- sync real data from every connector, verify raw event -> embed -> enrich -> Qdrant works correctly, build file/attachment extraction, validate relationship graph, and prove search returns meaningful results with concrete search-then-verify testing.

**Phase Ordering Rationale:**

- Sync + pipeline verification first (Phase 35) because everything depends on having real data flowing correctly through the pipeline -- you cannot validate relationships or search without memories in the database
- File/attachment processing (Phase 36) is NEW functionality that must be built before search can cover attachment content -- it depends on having synced data to know what files look like
- Relationship graph validation (Phase 37) requires both memories and file/attachment links to be in place -- verifying contacts, entities, and memory links needs the complete data picture
- Search quality validation (Phase 38) comes last because it tests the entire stack -- you need correct memories, correct entities, correct contacts, correct file links, and correct Qdrant vectors before search validation is meaningful

**Summary:**

- [ ] **Phase 35: Data Sync & Pipeline Verification** - Sync all 6 connectors and verify embed/enrich pipeline produces correct memories with proper source types, embeddings, contacts, entities, factuality, and Qdrant vectors
- [ ] **Phase 36: File & Attachment Processing** - Build file/photo extraction from emails and messages as standalone memories linked to their parent
- [ ] **Phase 37: Relationship Graph Validation** - Verify contact associations, entity extraction, and memory links across all connector types
- [ ] **Phase 38: Search Quality Validation** - Test semantic, cross-connector, contact-scoped, temporal, source-filtered, and attachment search against real data

## Phase Details (v4.0)

### Phase 35: Data Sync & Pipeline Verification

**Goal**: Real data from all 6 connector types flows through the complete pipeline and produces correct, searchable memories in PostgreSQL and Qdrant
**Depends on**: Phase 34 (codebase stable, all prior milestones shipped)
**Requirements**: SYNC-01, SYNC-02, SYNC-03, SYNC-04, SYNC-05, SYNC-06, PIPE-01, PIPE-02, PIPE-03, PIPE-04, PIPE-05, PIPE-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. User can trigger sync for each of the 6 connectors (Gmail, Slack, WhatsApp, iMessage, Photos-Immich, Locations) and see raw events created in the rawEvents table with connector-appropriate payload fields
2. Every synced raw event progresses through embed -> enrich pipeline to produce a Memory with correct source_type (email/message/photo/location), valid 768d embedding, and resolved Contact records
3. Enrich processor produces entities using the canonical 10-type taxonomy and classifies factuality (FACT/UNVERIFIED/FICTION) for every memory
4. Every enriched memory is upserted to Qdrant with correct payload fields (memory_id, source_type, connector_type, event_time) and is retrievable via vector search
5. Searching for content known to exist in synced data returns relevant results (basic sanity check per connector)
   **Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [ ] 35-01-PLAN.md — pipelineComplete flag + verification script
- [ ] 35-02-PLAN.md — Sync Gmail + Slack + WhatsApp, verify pipeline
- [ ] 35-03-PLAN.md — Sync iMessage + Photos-Immich + Locations, verify + cleanup

### Phase 36: File & Attachment Processing

**Goal**: Email attachments and message files are extracted as standalone memories with their own embeddings and linked to their parent message/email in the relationship graph
**Depends on**: Phase 35 (synced data must exist to know what attachments look like)
**Requirements**: PIPE-07, PIPE-08, PIPE-09, REL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Email attachments and message file shares produce standalone Memory records with source_type `file` (or `photo` for image files) separate from the parent memory
2. Photo-type attachments are processed through the vision model and have caption text extracted and stored as the memory text
3. Non-photo file attachments store metadata (filename, MIME type, size) and have meaningful text for embedding (filename + type description)
4. File/photo memories are linked to their parent memory via memoryLinks with a relationship type that indicates parent-child association
   **Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [ ] 35-01-PLAN.md — pipelineComplete flag + verification script
- [ ] 35-02-PLAN.md — Sync Gmail + Slack + WhatsApp, verify pipeline
- [ ] 35-03-PLAN.md — Sync iMessage + Photos-Immich + Locations, verify + cleanup

### Phase 37: Relationship Graph Validation

**Goal**: The memory graph accurately represents who said what, what entities were mentioned, and how memories relate to each other across all connector types
**Depends on**: Phase 36 (file links must be in place for complete graph validation)
**Requirements**: REL-01, REL-02, REL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Contact associations have correct roles per connector -- Gmail emails have sender/recipient contacts, Slack messages have sender contacts, WhatsApp messages have participant contacts, iMessage messages have sender/recipient contacts
2. Entity extraction produces meaningful entities per connector type -- emails yield person/organization/date entities, messages yield person/location entities, photos yield location/date entities, locations yield location entities
3. Memory links exist for contextually related content -- email threads link replies to originals, Slack thread replies link to parent messages, WhatsApp conversation messages within a time window are linked
   **Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [ ] 35-01-PLAN.md — pipelineComplete flag + verification script
- [ ] 35-02-PLAN.md — Sync Gmail + Slack + WhatsApp, verify pipeline
- [ ] 35-03-PLAN.md — Sync iMessage + Photos-Immich + Locations, verify + cleanup

### Phase 38: Search Quality Validation

**Goal**: Search across the full corpus of real data returns meaningful, well-ranked results for every search mode the system supports
**Depends on**: Phase 37 (complete relationship graph for contact-scoped and entity-based search)
**Requirements**: SRCH-01, SRCH-02, SRCH-03, SRCH-04, SRCH-05, SRCH-06, SRCH-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Natural language queries return semantically relevant results across all source types, and results are properly weighted using the 5-weight formula (semantic + rerank + recency + importance + trust)
2. A single query that spans multiple connectors returns results from at least 2 different source types (cross-connector search works)
3. Searching scoped to a specific contact returns only memories associated with that person, and temporal queries ("last week", "in January") return time-bounded results
4. Source-type filtering works -- searching within "emails only", "messages only", "photos only", or "files only" returns correctly filtered results
5. Searching for content within attachments returns results -- photo captions and file metadata are searchable alongside regular memory text
   **Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [ ] 35-01-PLAN.md — pipelineComplete flag + verification script
- [ ] 35-02-PLAN.md — Sync Gmail + Slack + WhatsApp, verify pipeline
- [ ] 35-03-PLAN.md — Sync iMessage + Photos-Immich + Locations, verify + cleanup
