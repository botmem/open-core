<summary>v1.0 MVP (Phases 1-3) - SHIPPED 2026-03-07</summary>

### Phase 1: Search Quality
**Goal**: Users get meaningfully ranked search results where frequently-accessed and pinned memories surface reliably, and the reranker fills the empty 0.30 weight slot in the scoring formula
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: SRCH-01, SRCH-02, SRCH-03, SRCH-04, SRCH-05, SRCH-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Search results are visibly reranked -- querying the same term returns different ordering than before, with more contextually relevant results at the top
  2. User can pin a memory from the UI, and that memory consistently appears in relevant searches regardless of age
  3. Viewing a search result multiple times causes it to rank higher in future searches for similar queries
  4. Reranking completes within 3 seconds for a typical search (no perceptible freeze)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Reranker integration (SRCH-01, SRCH-02)
- [x] 01-02: Pinning and importance reinforcement (SRCH-03, SRCH-04, SRCH-05, SRCH-06)

### Phase 2: Operational Maturity
**Goal**: The system maintains accurate scores over time through automated decay, and usage is tracked via PostHog so search and sync patterns are observable
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: OPS-01, OPS-02, OPS-03, OPS-04, OPS-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Old unpinned memories naturally rank lower over time without manual intervention
  2. PostHog dashboard shows search, sync, and pin events when API key is configured
  3. System runs normally with no errors when PostHog API key is absent
  4. Decay job runs nightly without blocking normal API operations
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Nightly decay job (OPS-01, OPS-02)
- [x] 02-02: PostHog analytics integration (OPS-03, OPS-04, OPS-05)

### Phase 3: Extensibility
**Goal**: Users can drop plugin files into the plugins directory to add custom connectors, scorers, or lifecycle hooks without modifying core code
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: EXT-01, EXT-02, EXT-03, EXT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A sample enricher plugin in the plugins directory runs automatically during the enrich pipeline
  2. Lifecycle hooks fire at documented points (afterIngest, afterEmbed, afterEnrich, afterSearch) and plugin code can observe memory events
  3. Plugin interface is documented with working example that a developer can copy and modify
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Plugin registry and loading infrastructure (EXT-01, EXT-03)
- [x] 03-02: Hook wiring, scorer integration, and sample plugin (EXT-02, EXT-04)

<summary>v1.1 PostHog Analytics Activation (Phase 4) - SHIPPED 2026-03-07</summary>

### Phase 4: PostHog Analytics Activation
**Goal**: PostHog receives real analytics events from both frontend and backend, with comprehensive product tracking across all key user actions
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: CFG-01, CFG-02, VER-01, VER-02, VER-03, VER-04, VER-05, COV-01, COV-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. PostHog dashboard shows pageview events when user navigates between pages in the web app
  2. PostHog dashboard shows search, pin/unpin, sync_complete, and sync_error events with correct properties
  3. Connector setup completions and graph view interactions appear as tracked events in PostHog
  4. Removing API keys from environment variables causes zero errors and zero network calls to PostHog
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Config + coverage gaps (CFG-02, COV-01, COV-02)
- [x] 04-02: API key setup + end-to-end verification (CFG-01, VER-01, VER-02, VER-03, VER-04, VER-05)

## v1.2 PostHog Deep Analytics

**Milestone Goal:** Enable all valuable free PostHog features -- session replay, heatmaps, error tracking, web analytics, and product analytics dashboards -- for comprehensive Botmem usage insights.

- [ ] **Phase 5: SDK Feature Enablement** - Configure posthog-js and backend SDK to enable replay, heatmaps, autocapture, error tracking, and user identification
- [ ] **Phase 6: Verification and Dashboards** - Verify data flows into PostHog and build product analytics dashboards

## Phase Details

### Phase 5: SDK Feature Enablement
**Goal**: All PostHog deep analytics features are actively capturing data from Botmem sessions
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (PostHog SDK already integrated and sending events)
**Requirements**: REPLAY-01, REPLAY-03, HEAT-01, HEAT-03, ERR-01, ERR-03, WEB-03, ID-01, ID-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Browsing Botmem generates session replay recordings with text inputs masked and network requests captured (auth headers redacted)
  2. Clicking and scrolling on pages produces autocapture events including rageclicks, and UTM/referrer data is captured on page views
  3. A deliberately thrown JS error appears as a captured exception in PostHog, and an unhandled backend exception is sent as a server-side error
  4. After page load, PostHog identifies the session with a stable user ID and sets connectors_count and memories_count as person properties
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 05-01-PLAN.md -- Enable session replay, autocapture, heatmaps, error tracking, network recording, and backend exception filter
- [ ] 05-02-PLAN.md -- User identification with stable ID and person properties

### Phase 6: Verification and Dashboards
**Goal**: PostHog dashboards provide actionable insights on Botmem usage patterns
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (data must be flowing before dashboards can be built)
**Requirements**: REPLAY-02, HEAT-02, ERR-02, WEB-01, WEB-02, PROD-01, PROD-02, PROD-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Session recordings are playable in PostHog Replay tab and heatmap overlay is visible on Botmem pages via PostHog toolbar
  2. Errors with stack traces appear in PostHog Error Tracking view
  3. PostHog web analytics dashboard shows page views, unique visitors, session counts, and navigation paths between pages
  4. A saved PostHog dashboard exists with insights for searches/day, syncs/day, memories created, a connector setup funnel, and a search retention insight
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 06-01: TBD
- [ ] 06-02: TBD
