# Botmem — Personal Memory RAG System

## What This Is

A local-first personal memory platform that ingests events from multiple data sources (emails, messages, photos, locations), normalizes them into a unified memory schema, and provides cross-modal retrieval with weighted ranking. Built as a pnpm monorepo with NestJS API, React frontend, and pluggable connector architecture. Designed for a single person to query their entire digital life through semantic search and a force-directed graph visualization.

## Core Value

Every piece of personal communication and digital interaction is searchable, connected, and queryable — with factuality labeling so the user always knows what's verified vs. hearsay.

### Active

<!-- Current scope. Building toward these. -->

- [ ] User authentication (email+password, JWT access+refresh tokens)
- [ ] API keys (named, read-only, bank-scoped)
- [ ] Memory banks (data isolation, sync-time selection)
- [ ] Encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM for credentials)
- [ ] E2EE for prod-core (Argon2id key derivation, client-side encryption)
- [ ] PostgreSQL dual-driver with RLS
- [ ] Firebase auth for prod-core

## Current Milestone: v3.0 Monorepo & Developer Experience

**Goal:** Transform the hacked-together monorepo into a production-grade, plug-and-play development environment — proper tooling, Docker Compose with all services, build gates with tests, and no dev experience footguns like port conflicts.

**Target features:**
- Proper pnpm workspace + Turborepo configuration following latest best practices
- Docker Compose that's truly plug-and-play (includes Ollama, Redis, Qdrant — one command to run)
- Fix port conflict issues (file changes spawning competing instances)
- Tests must pass before build succeeds (build pipeline gates)
- Monorepo structure ready for productionization and commercialization
- Consistent tsconfig, linting, and build configuration across all packages

## Paused Milestone: v2.0 Security, Auth & Encryption (24% complete)

**Goal:** Add user authentication, API keys, memory banks, encryption at rest, E2EE for prod-core, and PostgreSQL with RLS — transforming Botmem from a completely open system into a properly secured personal memory platform.

**Target features:**
- User auth: email+password (open-core), Firebase (prod-core) — always required, no bypass
- API keys: named, read-only, scoped to memory bank(s)
- Memory banks: data isolation units, selected at sync time
- Encryption at rest: AES-256-GCM for auth context + connector credentials
- E2EE (prod-core): Argon2id key derivation, client-side encryption of memory text+metadata
- PostgreSQL dual-driver with RLS for prod-core data isolation
- CORS locked to FRONTEND_URL, auth guard on all endpoints

## Queued Milestone: v2.1 Data Quality & Pipeline Integrity

**Goal:** Fix source type misclassification (photos stored as `file`), tame entity extraction chaos (100+ hallucinated types instead of 10 canonical), deduplicate entities, unify entity format, and backfill existing data — so search, filtering, and the memory graph actually work correctly.

**Target features:**
- Fix source type classification: photos emit `photo` not `file`, backfill existing records
- Enforce canonical entity type taxonomy (10 types) with structured output constraints
- Deduplicate entities within and across memories
- Unify entity format (embed vs enrich step produce different shapes)
- Clean up empty/garbage entity values
- Fix entity misclassification (names classified as locations/organizations)
- Backfill pipeline to re-enrich existing memories with corrected extraction

## Queued Milestone: v3.1 Production Deployment & CI/CD

**Goal:** Deploy Botmem to production with Docker/Caddy/CI-CD, OpenRouter inference abstraction, and automated deployment pipelines. (Deferred from old v2.0, renumbered after v3.0 Monorepo.)

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries. Includes reasoning to prevent re-adding. -->

- Native image embedding retrieval — deferred; image retrieval via OCR/caption/metadata for v1
- Multi-person identity graph — single target person only in v1
- Automatic deletion policy engine — manual/admin-driven in v1
- Mobile app — web-first
- Real-time chat ingestion — batch sync only in v1

## Context

- **Monorepo**: pnpm 9.15 workspaces + Turbo 2.4, TypeScript (ES2022, strict, ESNext modules)
- **Backend**: NestJS 11, Drizzle ORM + SQLite (better-sqlite3, WAL mode), BullMQ on Redis
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite 6, React Router 7, Zustand 5, Tailwind 4, react-force-graph-2d
- **AI**: Ollama (remote at 192.168.10.250) — nomic-embed-text (768d embeddings), qwen3:0.6b (text), qwen3-vl:2b (vision)
- **Vector DB**: Qdrant (cosine similarity, auto-created collection)
- **Port**: API on 12412, web on 5173
- **WhatsApp limitation**: LID format only, no phone number resolution possible via Baileys v6
- **Git remote**: github.com/botmem org (open-core public, prod-core private)
- **Domain**: botmem.xyz (Spaceship, DNS not yet configured)
- 6 connectors implemented and working
- Contacts system fully operational with cross-connector dedup

## Constraints

- **AI Infrastructure**: Ollama runs externally on 192.168.10.250 (RTX 3070) — not containerized, configured by env var
- **Storage**: SQLite only (no PostgreSQL) — WAL mode for concurrent reads, simple deployment
- **Embedding**: nomic-embed-text produces 768d vectors — model change requires re-embedding all memories
- **WhatsApp**: Baileys v6 LID format means phone numbers are not resolvable; history only delivered to first QR-linked socket

## Key Decisions

<!-- Decisions that constrain future work. Add throughout project lifecycle. -->

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| SQLite over PostgreSQL | Simpler deployment, single-user system, WAL mode sufficient | ✓ Good |
| NestJS over FastAPI | TypeScript monorepo consistency, better ecosystem fit | ✓ Good |
| BullMQ over Celery | Native Node.js, no Python dependency, Redis-backed | ✓ Good |
| nomic-embed-text over Qwen embedding | Available on Ollama, 768d vectors, good quality | ✓ Good |
| Contacts as first-class entities | Rich cross-connector identity needed for meaningful search | ✓ Good |
| Store all memories, label factuality | Never lose data, let user filter by confidence | ✓ Good |
| PostHog for analytics | Self-hostable, privacy-respecting, generous free tier | ✓ Good |
| PostHog cloud over self-hosted | 16GB RAM requirement disproportionate for single-user | ✓ Good |

| SQLite → PostgreSQL for production | Production needs concurrent writes, RLS for data isolation | — Pending |
| Local auth (open-core) + Firebase (prod-core) | Open-core self-contained, prod-core gets social login | — Pending |
| Auth always on, no bypass | Security-first: every endpoint requires authentication | — Pending |
| E2EE with Argon2id key derivation | Zero-knowledge: server never sees plaintext, lost password = lost data | — Pending |
| Memory banks for data isolation | Logical partitioning for sync scoping and API key access | — Pending |
| AES-256-GCM encryption at rest | Protect auth context and credentials in SQLite/Postgres | — Pending |
