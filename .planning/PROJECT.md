# Botmem — Personal Memory RAG System

## What This Is

A local-first personal memory platform that ingests events from multiple data sources (emails, messages, photos, locations), normalizes them into a unified memory schema, and provides cross-modal retrieval with weighted ranking. Built as a pnpm monorepo with NestJS API, React frontend, and pluggable connector architecture. Designed for a single person to query their entire digital life through semantic search and a force-directed graph visualization. Deployed to production at botmem.xyz with Firebase auth, PostgreSQL + RLS, E2EE, and automated CI/CD.

## Core Value

Every piece of personal communication and digital interaction is searchable, connected, and queryable — with factuality labeling so the user always knows what's verified vs. hearsay.

### Active

<!-- Current scope. Building toward these. -->

<!-- v2.0 remaining (API Keys — paused) -->

- [ ] API keys: named, read-only, scoped to memory bank(s), hashed storage — Phase 18

<!-- v4.0 E2E Testing (planned, starts after v2.0) -->

- [ ] Fixture capture infrastructure: `scripts/generate-fixtures.ts`, JSON LLM I/O recordings
- [ ] Pipeline integration tests: embed/enrich/sync processors with real Postgres + fixture LLM
- [ ] API HTTP integration tests: all endpoints via Supertest
- [ ] Connector parsing tests: Gmail, Slack, iMessage, Immich, Locations with recorded responses
- [ ] CI gates: GitHub Actions test workflow, fixture cache, 80% coverage enforcement

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries. Includes reasoning to prevent re-adding. -->

- Native image embedding retrieval — deferred; image retrieval via OCR/caption/metadata for v1
- Multi-person identity graph — single target person only in v1
- Automatic deletion policy engine — manual/admin-driven in v1
- Mobile app — web-first
- Real-time chat ingestion — batch sync only in v1
- Key escrow / password recovery — zero-knowledge E2EE by design
- Write-capable API keys — read-only sufficient for agent/CLI use

## Current Milestone: v4.0 Fix Search Once and For All

**Goal:** Validate the entire pipeline end-to-end — sync real data from every connector, verify raw event → embed → enrich → Qdrant works correctly, and prove search returns meaningful results with concrete search-then-verify testing.

**Target features:**

- Sync real data from all 6 connector types (Gmail, Slack, WhatsApp, iMessage, Photos-Immich, Locations)
- Verify pipeline produces correct memories with entities, contacts, factuality labels per connector
- Validate relationship graph (memory links, contact associations, entity extraction)
- Define search assumptions per connector type and validate by actually searching
- Fix any pipeline/search issues discovered during validation

## Deferred: v5.0 E2E Testing & Test Infrastructure

**Goal:** Fixture-based integration and API-level testing (moved from v4.0).

## Paused: v2.0 Security, Auth & Encryption (Phase 18 remaining)

**Status:** 25/30 requirements complete. Only API Keys (KEY-01 through KEY-05, Phase 18) remain.

## Context

- **Monorepo**: pnpm 9.15 workspaces + Turbo 2.4, TypeScript (ES2022, strict, ESNext modules)
- **Backend**: NestJS 11, Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL, BullMQ on Redis
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite 6, React Router 7, Zustand 5, Tailwind 4, react-force-graph-2d
- **AI**: Ollama (remote at 192.168.10.250) — nomic-embed-text (768d embeddings), qwen3:0.6b (text), qwen3-vl:2b (vision)
- **Vector DB**: Qdrant (cosine similarity, auto-created collection)
- **Port**: API on 12412, web on 5173
- **Production**: botmem.xyz on Vultr VPS, Docker + Caddy + Watchtower auto-deploy
- **Auth**: Firebase (prod-core) with Google/GitHub social login; local email+password (open-core)
- **Git remote**: github.com/botmem org (open-core public, prod-core private)
- **Codebase**: ~42K LOC TypeScript, 447 commits, 977 files
- 6 connectors implemented and working
- Contacts system fully operational with cross-connector dedup

## Constraints

- **AI Infrastructure**: Ollama runs externally on 192.168.10.250 (RTX 3070) — not containerized, configured by env var
- **Embedding**: nomic-embed-text produces 768d vectors — model change requires re-embedding all memories
- **WhatsApp**: Baileys v6 LID format means phone numbers are not resolvable; history only delivered to first QR-linked socket
- **VPS**: 2GB RAM + 6.2GB swap — limits concurrent container count
