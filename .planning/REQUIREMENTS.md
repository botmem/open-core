# Requirements: Botmem

**Core Value:** Every piece of personal communication is searchable, connected, and queryable -- with factuality labeling so the user knows what's verified vs. hearsay.

## v2.0 Requirements -- Security, Auth & Encryption

**Defined:** 2026-03-08

### User Auth (Open-Core) — always required, no bypass

- [x] **AUTH-01**: Register with email + password (bcrypt hash, minimum 8 chars)
- [x] **AUTH-02**: Login → JWT access token (15min) + httpOnly refresh cookie (7d)
- [x] **AUTH-03**: Refresh access token via `POST /auth/refresh` using refresh cookie
- [x] **AUTH-04**: Password reset via email link (cryptographic token, 1hr expiry)
- [x] **AUTH-05**: Session persistence via refresh token rotation (old token invalidated on use)

### Firebase Auth (Prod-Core)

- [x] **FBAUTH-01**: NestJS guard verifies Firebase ID tokens via `firebase-admin` SDK
- [x] **FBAUTH-02**: React login/register UI with Firebase client SDK (email+password, Google, GitHub)
- [x] **FBAUTH-03**: `AUTH_PROVIDER=local|firebase` env var selects auth provider at startup
- [x] **FBAUTH-04**: Firebase social login (Google, GitHub) available in prod-core only

### API Security

- [x] **SEC-01**: Auth guard on all endpoints (except `/health`, `/version`, `/auth/*`)
- [x] **SEC-02**: CORS locked to `FRONTEND_URL` origin(s), credentials mode enabled

### API Keys

- [ ] **KEY-01**: Create multiple named API keys per user (cryptographic generation, stored hashed)
- [ ] **KEY-02**: All API keys are read-only (search, list memories/contacts — no writes, no sync, no delete)
- [ ] **KEY-03**: Keys scoped to specific memory bank(s) at creation time
- [ ] **KEY-04**: List and revoke API keys via authenticated endpoints
- [ ] **KEY-05**: API keys authenticate via `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header, coexist with JWT auth

### Memory Banks

- [x] **BANK-01**: Create, list, rename, and delete memory banks per user
- [x] **BANK-02**: Select target memory bank at sync time (connector sync config)
- [x] **BANK-03**: Search scoped to accessible bank(s) — user's own banks + API key bank scope
- [x] **BANK-04**: Default bank created on registration + migration of existing data into default bank

### Encryption at Rest (Open-Core)

- [x] **ENC-01**: AES-256-GCM encryption for `authContext` (accounts table) and `connectorCredentials` table, key derived from `APP_SECRET` env var
- [x] **ENC-02**: Migration script to encrypt existing plaintext credentials with zero downtime

### E2EE (Prod-Core)

- [x] **E2EE-01**: Encryption key derived from user password via Argon2id (client-side, in browser)
- [x] **E2EE-02**: Memory text + metadata encrypted client-side before storage (server never sees plaintext)
- [x] **E2EE-03**: Embedding vectors stay plaintext (semantic search continues to work)
- [x] **E2EE-04**: Password change re-derives key + re-encrypts all user memories (batched, resumable)

### Database

- [x] **DB-01**: PostgreSQL schema (`schema.ts`) uses pgTable with native Postgres types (boolean, timestamptz, jsonb, doublePrecision)
- [x] **DB-02**: DbService uses pg Pool + NodePgDatabase with async init and graceful shutdown
- [x] **DB-03**: ConfigService validates DATABASE_URL at startup (fail-fast OnModuleInit pattern)
- [x] **DB-04**: SQLite FTS5 ported to PostgreSQL tsvector + GIN index for full-text search
- [x] **DB-05**: PostgreSQL RLS policies isolate user data — each user sees only their own memories, accounts, contacts

## v2.1 Requirements -- Data Quality & Pipeline Integrity

**Defined:** 2026-03-08

### Source Type Classification

- [x] **SRC-01**: Photos connector emits `photo` source type instead of `file`
- [x] **SRC-02**: Existing photo memories reclassified from `file` to `photo` in SQLite
- [x] **SRC-03**: Qdrant vector payloads updated with corrected `source_type` for photos
- [x] **SRC-04**: `SOURCE_TYPE_ALIASES` hack removed from NLQ parser and memory service

### Entity Extraction Quality

- [x] **ENT-01**: Entity extraction enforces canonical 10-type taxonomy via post-processing validation
- [x] **ENT-02**: Garbage entity values stripped (empty strings, single characters, pronouns, URLs, generic terms)
- [x] **ENT-03**: Duplicate entities within a single memory are deduplicated by normalized value+type
- [x] **ENT-04**: Entity extraction prompt improved with connector-aware examples and stricter instructions
- [x] **ENT-05**: Entity count capped per memory to prevent extraction bloat

### Entity Format & Storage

- [x] **FMT-01**: Entity format unified to single `{type, value}` shape across embed and enrich steps
- [x] **FMT-02**: `createLinks` duplicate link bug fixed with existence check before insert
- [x] **FMT-03**: Embed-step entities persisted in memory metadata for traceability

### Data Backfill

- [x] **BKF-01**: Backfill pipeline re-enriches existing memories with corrected entity extraction
- [x] **BKF-02**: Backfill is resumable and interruptible (tracks progress, skips completed)
- [x] **BKF-03**: Backfill progress visible via WebSocket real-time updates
- [x] **BKF-04**: Backfill supports selective filtering by connector type

### Verification

- [x] **VER-01**: Fresh re-sync of a connector produces correct source types and clean entities without backfill
- [x] **VER-02**: Photo search returns only photos (not Slack file attachments)
- [x] **VER-03**: Entity graph shows deduplicated, correctly-typed entities
- [x] **VER-04**: NLQ queries for photos use `photo` source type naturally

### v2.1 Out of Scope

| Feature                                         | Reason                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cross-memory entity dedup (global entity table) | Adds significant complexity; per-memory dedup is sufficient for v2.1 |
| Entity linking to external knowledge bases      | Overkill for personal memory system                                  |
| Upgrading Ollama model (qwen3:0.6b -> larger)   | Test improvements with current model first                           |
| rawEvents payload JSON mutation                 | Treat rawEvents as immutable audit log                               |

- Mapped to phases: 18 (Phases 25-28)
- Unmapped: 0

## v3.0 Requirements -- Monorepo & Developer Experience

**Defined:** 2026-03-08

### Code Quality

- [x] **QUAL-01**: Developer can run ESLint across all packages with a single command and get consistent TypeScript linting
- [x] **QUAL-02**: All code is auto-formatted on save/commit with Prettier using consistent rules
- [x] **QUAL-03**: Developer can run typecheck across all packages as a standalone Turbo task
- [x] **QUAL-04**: Committing code automatically runs lint+format on staged files; pushing runs typecheck+tests on changed packages

### Dev Workflow

- [x] **DEV-01**: Running `pnpm dev` starts the full dev environment without port conflicts or restart storms
- [x] **DEV-02**: File changes in workspace packages trigger dependency-aware restarts without manual pre-builds
- [x] **DEV-03**: Adding a new connector package requires zero changes to the root dev script or watch config
- [x] **DEV-04**: All library packages have proper conditional exports fields enabling clean resolution by both CJS and ESM consumers

### Docker & Infrastructure

- [x] **DOCK-01**: Running `docker compose up` starts Redis + Qdrant with health checks; `--profile ollama` adds Ollama
- [x] **DOCK-02**: Developer can run `make dev` to start infrastructure + app with a single command
- [x] **DOCK-03**: New developers can read `.env.example` to understand all required and optional environment variables
- [x] **DOCK-04**: `GET /api/health` returns connectivity status of Redis, Qdrant, and SQLite

### Build Optimization

- [x] **BUILD-01**: TypeScript, Vitest, and Vite versions are defined once in pnpm catalogs, referenced everywhere
- [x] **BUILD-02**: Production Docker image uses multi-stage build with turbo prune for minimal image size

### v3.0 Out of Scope

| Feature                           | Reason                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pnpm 10 upgrade                   | Breaking changes (no hoisting, lifecycle script restrictions) — risk outweighs benefit |
| Nx migration                      | Turbo is sufficient, already in use, lower migration cost                              |
| Biome (ESLint replacement)        | ESLint ecosystem is larger, typescript-eslint is mature, Biome still stabilizing       |
| TypeScript project references     | Maintenance burden exceeds compile-time benefit at <15 packages                        |
| Shared config packages            | Overengineered for single-developer monorepo — root configs sufficient                 |
| Changesets / version management   | Not publishing to npm, no external consumers                                           |
| commitlint / conventional commits | Nice-to-have but adds friction without team coordination need                          |
| CJS → ESM migration for API       | NestJS 11 does not officially support ESM (issue #13319). High risk, zero user value   |

## v4.0 Requirements — Fix Search Once and For All

**Defined:** 2026-03-09

Validate the entire pipeline end-to-end — sync real data from every connector, verify raw event → embed → enrich → Qdrant works correctly, and prove search returns meaningful results.

### Data Ingestion

- [ ] **SYNC-01**: User can sync Gmail and produce raw email events with sender/recipients/body/subject
- [ ] **SYNC-02**: User can sync Slack and produce raw message events with channel/user/thread context
- [ ] **SYNC-03**: User can sync WhatsApp and produce raw message events with participant info
- [ ] **SYNC-04**: User can sync iMessage and produce raw message events with contact associations
- [ ] **SYNC-05**: User can sync Photos-Immich and produce raw photo events with EXIF/location/caption
- [ ] **SYNC-06**: User can sync Locations and produce raw GPS events with timestamp/coordinates

### Pipeline Processing

- [x] **PIPE-01**: Embed processor creates Memory with correct source_type per connector (email/message/photo/location/file)
- [x] **PIPE-02**: Embed processor generates valid 768d embedding for every memory
- [x] **PIPE-03**: Embed processor resolves participants to deduplicated Contact records
- [x] **PIPE-04**: Enrich processor extracts entities using canonical 10-type taxonomy
- [x] **PIPE-05**: Enrich processor classifies factuality (FACT/UNVERIFIED/FICTION) with confidence
- [x] **PIPE-06**: Enrich processor upserts vector to Qdrant with correct payload (memory_id, source_type, connector_type, event_time)
- [ ] **PIPE-07**: File attachments extracted as standalone memories with source_type `file` (own node on graph)
- [ ] **PIPE-08**: Photo-type files processed through vision model for caption extraction, stored as source_type `photo`
- [ ] **PIPE-09**: Non-photo files stored with metadata (filename, type, size) and linked to parent memory

### Relationship Graph

- [ ] **REL-01**: Contact associations created with correct roles (sender/recipient/mentioned) per connector
- [ ] **REL-02**: Entity extraction produces meaningful entities (people, organizations, locations, dates) per connector type
- [ ] **REL-03**: Memory links created for contextually related content (thread replies, conversations)
- [ ] **REL-04**: File/photo memories linked to their parent memory (email, message) in the relationship graph

### Search Quality

- [ ] **SRCH-01**: Semantic search returns relevant memories for natural language queries across all source types
- [ ] **SRCH-02**: Search results properly weighted (semantic + rerank + recency + importance + trust)
- [ ] **SRCH-03**: Cross-connector search returns results from multiple sources for a single query
- [ ] **SRCH-04**: Contact-scoped search finds memories associated with a specific person
- [ ] **SRCH-05**: Temporal search returns time-bounded results ("last week", "in January")
- [ ] **SRCH-06**: Source-type filtering works (search within emails only, messages only, photos only, files only)
- [ ] **SRCH-07**: User can search for content within attachments (photo captions, file metadata)
