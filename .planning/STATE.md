# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Every piece of personal communication is searchable, connected, and queryable -- with factuality labeling so the user knows what's verified vs. hearsay.
**Current focus:** v1.4 Search Intelligence -- Phase 9 (Temporal Reasoning) in progress

## Current Position

Phase: 9 of 15 (Temporal Reasoning)
Plan: 1 of 2 complete
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-03-08 -- Phase 9 Plan 01 complete (NLQ parser with chrono-node)

Progress: [██████████] 96%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.4]: Use Ollama structured output (`format` parameter) for entity extraction -- eliminates regex parsing
- [v1.4]: chrono-node for temporal parsing -- deterministic, no LLM in search hot path (PERF-01)
- [v1.4]: Backfill entity types via SQL string replacement -- no LLM re-run needed
- [v1.4]: Entity taxonomy includes "pet" type for personal use (Nugget)
- [v1.4]: Summarization deferred to v1.5 (SUM-01, SUM-02)
- [v2.0]: Multiple filter-repo passes needed to sanitize secret fragments in grep patterns within planning docs
- [v2.0]: OwnTracks hostname treated as secret (reveals private infrastructure)
- [Phase 08]: Migration uses better-sqlite3 directly for one-time scripts, with conditional column existence checks
- [Phase 08.1]: Strict 3x threshold for entity type reclassification to avoid false positives from noisy entity extraction data
- [Phase 08.1]: Safety-tiered auto-merge: non-person exact-name and sparse-to-rich are auto-merged, person-to-person preserved for manual review
- [Phase 11]: Keep origin remote as personal repo, open-core remote for org
- [Phase 09]: Custom chrono-node wrappers for 'last week' (Mon-Sun) and 'between X and Y' (combine results)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 8.1 inserted after Phase 8: Contact Auto-Merge (URGENT) — auto-merge obvious contact duplicates to eliminate manual merge review for exact-name non-person entities

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.

### Quick Tasks Completed

| # | Description | Date | Commit | Directory |
