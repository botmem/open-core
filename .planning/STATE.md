# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** Every piece of personal communication is searchable, connected, and queryable -- with factuality labeling so the user knows what's verified vs. hearsay.
**Current focus:** Phase 3: Extensibility

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 3 (Extensibility)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase (executing)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-07 -- Completed 03-01 Plugin Registry

Progress: [████████░░] 83%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 3.75min
- Total execution time: 0.25 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-search-quality | 2/2 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 02-operational-maturity | 2/2 | 8min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3min), 01-02 (4min), 02-01 (4min), 02-02 (4min)
- Trend: Consistent

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 02 P02 | 4min | 2 tasks | 8 files |
| Phase 03 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 6 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Reranker uses generate API workaround, not native /api/rerank (blocked upstream PR #7219)
- [Roadmap]: PostHog cloud free tier, not self-hosted (16GB RAM requirement disproportionate)
- [01-01]: Use logprobs softmax (yes/(yes+no)) for rerank scoring
- [01-01]: Fallback to 0.70 semantic weight when reranker unavailable
- [01-01]: Rerank only top 15 candidates to bound latency
- [01-02]: Used ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN for schema migration instead of drizzle-kit push
- [01-02]: Pin toggle visible on hover for unpinned, always visible when pinned
- [01-02]: recordRecall is fire-and-forget to avoid blocking UI
- [Phase 02]: AnalyticsModule is @Global() so all modules can inject without explicit imports
- [Phase 02]: distinctId='server' for all backend analytics events to avoid PII
- [02-01]: Used upsertJobScheduler (not deprecated repeat API) for idempotent decay scheduling
- [02-01]: Decay processor preserves existing semantic/rerank scores, only recomputes time-dependent fields
- [Phase 03-01]: fireHook passes Object.freeze({...data}) to prevent plugins from mutating pipeline state
- [Phase 03-01]: Promise.allSettled with try-catch for both sync and async handler error isolation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Reranker latency via generate API on RTX 3070 is unknown -- needs benchmarking during implementation
