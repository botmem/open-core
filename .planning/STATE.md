# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Every piece of personal communication is searchable, connected, and queryable -- with factuality labeling so the user knows what's verified vs. hearsay.
**Current focus:** v1.2 PostHog Deep Analytics -- Phase 6 in progress

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 6 (Verification and Dashboards)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase (06-01 complete)
Status: Phase 6 in progress, 06-01 verification complete
Last activity: 2026-03-08 -- Completed 06-01 PostHog Data Flow Verification

Progress: [##########] v1.0 complete | [##########] v1.1 complete | [█████████░] 92% v1.2

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 04]: connector_setup fires only on new account creation, not re-auth
- [Phase 04]: graph_view uses ref guard to fire only once per mount
- [Phase 02]: AnalyticsModule is @Global() so all modules can inject without explicit imports
- [Phase 02]: distinctId='server' for all backend analytics events to avoid PII
- [v1.0]: PostHog cloud over self-hosted (16GB RAM disproportionate for single-user)
- [v1.0]: PostHog SDK integration ships as no-op when unconfigured
- [Phase 04]: Used EU PostHog instance (eu.i.posthog.com) per user preference
- [Phase 05]: Used maskCapturedNetworkRequestFn for network header redaction (correct PostHog SDK v1.359 API)
- [Phase 05]: Backend exception filter only captures 5xx errors to avoid noise from 404s/validation
- [Phase 05]: PostHogExceptionFilter extends BaseExceptionFilter to preserve default NestJS responses
- [Phase 05]: User ID priority: email > contactId > fallback for stable PostHog session linking
- [Phase 06]: PostHogExceptionFilter must receive HttpAdapterHost to avoid TypeError when handling exceptions
