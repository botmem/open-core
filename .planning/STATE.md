# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Every piece of personal communication is searchable, connected, and queryable -- with factuality labeling so the user knows what's verified vs. hearsay.
**Current focus:** v3.0 Monorepo & Developer Experience -- Phase 30 Plan 02 complete

## Current Position

Phase: 30 (Dev Workflow Fix) -- in progress
Plan: 02 (complete)
Status: Phase 30 Plan 02 complete (health endpoint), Plan 01 pending
Last activity: 2026-03-08 -- Phase 30 Plan 02 complete (health endpoint with sqlite/redis/qdrant probes)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 35min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.0]: Auth always on -- no dev bypass, even open-core requires login
- [v2.0]: Open-core = local email+password+JWT; Prod-core = Firebase (Google/GitHub social)
- [v2.0]: E2EE encrypts text+metadata only; vectors stay plaintext for search
- [v2.0]: Encryption key derived from user password (Argon2id) -- lost password = lost data
- [v2.0]: Memory bank selected at sync time (not auto-assigned per connector)
- [v2.0]: PostgreSQL included because RLS depends on it
- [v2.0]: Phase numbering continues from 15 (starts at 16)
- [Phase 16]: Access token in memory only -- never persisted; session restored via httpOnly refresh cookie
- [Phase 16]: 401 interceptor uses mutex Promise to prevent concurrent refresh races
- [Phase 16]: Password reset token stored as SHA-256 hash with 1hr expiry; existing unused tokens invalidated

### Decisions (Phase 16)

- [16-01]: Separate jwtAccessSecret/jwtRefreshSecret instead of single JWT_SECRET for defense-in-depth
- [16-01]: SHA-256 hash of refresh token stored in DB, raw token never persisted
- [16-01]: Dummy bcrypt hash comparison on non-existent users prevents timing-based email enumeration
- [16-01]: Token family UUID tracks refresh chain -- replaying revoked token kills entire family
- [16-02]: Lazy nodemailer transporter -- only create SMTP connection on first send
- [16-02]: Graceful mail failure -- log errors but never throw from sendResetEmail
- [16-02]: Console fallback in dev -- log reset URL to stdout when SMTP not configured

### Decisions (Phase 17)

- [17-01]: CORS supports comma-separated FRONTEND_URL for multi-origin deployments
- [17-01]: WebSocket auth via token query param (not header) for browser WebSocket API compatibility
- [17-01]: WsClient refuses to connect without token -- prevents pre-auth connection attempts

### Decisions (Phase 25)

- [25-01]: Migration scripts use main().catch() pattern instead of top-level await for tsx CJS compatibility

### Decisions (Phase 29)

- [29-01]: Single root eslint.config.mjs -- no per-package ESLint configs (monorepo anti-pattern)
- [29-01]: no-explicit-any as warn not error -- codebase uses any extensively
- [29-01]: Web uses tsc --noEmit (not tsc -b --noEmit) to avoid TS6310 with referenced composite projects
- [29-01]: APP_SECRET added to .env.example -- was in config.service.ts but missing from plan template

### Decisions (Phase 26)

- [26-01]: 10-type canonical taxonomy (lowercase): person, organization, location, date, event, product, concept, quantity, language, other
- [26-01]: Normalizer is a pure function (no DI, no side effects) for easy testing and reuse
- [26-01]: Embed-shape entities (type/id/role) handled by parsing compound id format (name:X|email:Y)
- [26-02]: Bidirectional link dedup: check both src->dst and dst->src before inserting memoryLinks
- [26-02]: embedEntities stored as parallel normalized copy in metadata -- contact resolution untouched

### Decisions (Phase 30)

- [30-02]: Lazy ioredis connection (lazyConnect: true) -- only probes on health check, not on startup
- [30-02]: Promise.allSettled for concurrent health probing -- one slow service does not block others
- [30-02]: Health endpoint always returns HTTP 200 -- reports status, never fails itself

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Roadmap Evolution

- v2.0 paused at 26% (phases 16-17 complete, 25 complete, 18-24 + 26-28 remaining)
- v3.0 inserted for monorepo/DX work before resuming security milestone

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
