# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Every piece of personal communication is searchable, connected, and queryable -- with factuality labeling so the user knows what's verified vs. hearsay.
**Current focus:** v1.3 Test Coverage -- Phase 7 in progress

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 10 (Test Infrastructure Fixes)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (07-02 complete)
Status: Phase 7 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-08 -- Completed 07-02 Fix all failing tests

Progress: [##########] v1.0 complete | [##########] v1.1 complete | [##########] v1.2 complete | [█████████░] 93% v1.3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 11
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.65 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-search-quality | 2/2 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 02-operational-maturity | 2/2 | 8min | 4min |
| 03-extensibility | 2/2 | 9min | 4.5min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 04]: connector_setup fires only on new account creation, not re-auth
- [Phase 04]: graph_view uses ref guard to fire only once per mount
- [Phase 02]: AnalyticsModule is @Global() so all modules can inject without explicit imports
- [Phase 02]: distinctId='server' for all backend analytics events to avoid PII
- [v1.0]: PostHog cloud over self-hosted (16GB RAM disproportionate for single-user)
- [v1.0]: PostHog SDK integration ships as no-op when unconfigured
- [Phase 04]: Used EU PostHog instance (eu.i.posthog.com) per user preference
- [Phase 05]: Used maskCapturedNetworkRequestFn for network header redaction (correct PostHog SDK v1.359 API)
- [Phase 05]: Backend exception filter only captures 5xx errors to avoid noise from 404s/validation
- [Phase 05]: PostHogExceptionFilter extends BaseExceptionFilter to preserve default NestJS responses
- [Phase 05]: User ID priority: email > contactId > fallback for stable PostHog session linking
- [Phase 06]: PostHogExceptionFilter must receive HttpAdapterHost to avoid TypeError when handling exceptions
- [Phase 07]: Used @vitest/coverage-v8@^3 to match existing vitest@^3 peer dependency
- [Phase 07]: Standardized all coverage thresholds to 80/80/80/75 across monorepo
- [Phase 07]: Only test files modified to fix failures; no production code changes
- [Phase 07]: Mock loadBuiltin in plugins tests to prevent WhatsApp warm session hang
