## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 04]: connector_setup fires only on new account creation, not re-auth
- [Phase 04]: graph_view uses ref guard to fire only once per mount
- [Phase 02]: AnalyticsModule is @Global() so all modules can inject without explicit imports
- [Phase 02]: distinctId='server' for all backend analytics events to avoid PII
- [v1.0]: PostHog cloud over self-hosted (16GB RAM disproportionate for single-user)
- [v1.0]: PostHog SDK integration ships as no-op when unconfigured
- [Phase 04]: Used EU PostHog instance (eu.i.posthog.com) per user preference
