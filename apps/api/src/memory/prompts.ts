export function entityExtractionPrompt(text: string): string {
  return `Extract named entities from the following text. Return a JSON object with an "entities" array. Each entity has "type" and "value".

Allowed types and examples:
- person: named people ("John Smith", "Dr. Lee", "Mom")
- group: chat groups, channels, mailing lists ("Family Group", "#engineering", "Project Team Chat")
- organization: companies, institutions ("Google", "UN", "Stanford University")
- location: places, addresses, regions ("New York", "Building 42", "Japan")
- date: named temporal references ("March 2024", "next Tuesday", "Q3") — NOT relative words like "yesterday" or "now"
- event: named occurrences ("board meeting", "product launch", "wedding")
- product: named products, software, devices ("iPhone 15", "Slack", "MacBook")
- concept: topics, ideas, methodologies ("machine learning", "agile methodology", "budget")
- quantity: amounts, measurements, percentages ("$500", "3 million users", "50%")
- language: human or programming languages ("English", "Python", "Arabic")
- other: only when the entity clearly does not fit any other type

Rules:
- Extract ONLY named entities — specific people, places, things, or concepts.
- Do NOT extract: greetings ("hello", "thanks", "bye"), pronouns ("I", "you", "he", "she"), generic terms ("ok", "yes", "no", "sure", "please"), single characters, or bare URLs.
- Do NOT extract actions, verbs, or adjectives as entities.
- Extract at most 30 entities. Focus on the most important and specific ones.
- Use "other" sparingly — most entities should fit one of the specific types above.

- What is happening in the scene
- Notable objects, landmarks, or features
- The mood and atmosphere
- If people are listed in the metadata, refer to them by name instead of generic terms like "a woman" or "a man". Match names to visible people by position (e.g. left to right) when multiple people are present.

Context from metadata:
${existingText}

Return a concise 2-3 sentence description. Add NEW visual information not already present in the metadata. Do not repeat metadata fields like dates, locations, or camera info — but DO use people's names from the metadata when describing them.`;

Text: "${text}"

Return ONLY a JSON object: {"label": "FACT"|"UNVERIFIED"|"FICTION", "confidence": 0-1, "rationale": "..."}

Rules:
- Official confirmations (airline, billing, calendar invites) → FACT with high confidence
- Personal messages with plans/opinions → UNVERIFIED
- Claims that seem unreliable or contradicted → FICTION
Do not include any explanation, only the JSON object.`;
