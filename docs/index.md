## Quick Start

Get Botmem running in under two minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/botmem/botmem.git
cd botmem

# Start infrastructure (Redis + Qdrant)
docker compose up -d

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development servers
pnpm dev
```

The API serves on `http://localhost:12412` and the web UI on `http://localhost:12412`.

Connect your first data source from the web UI, or jump straight to the [Agent API](/agent-api/) to give your AI agents access to your personal memory.
